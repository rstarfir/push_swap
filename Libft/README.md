# Libft
### First 42 project.
### Re-coding of some functions from standart libc library.
### Only few functions was allowed to use: free(), malloc(), write().
### Code was written in Ecole42 norminette code style

To use libft.a in your program add #include "libft.h" to your header file and compile like this:
```
gcc function_from_lidft.c -I./includes -L./ -lft
```
